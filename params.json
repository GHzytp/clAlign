A normal correlation and a method of solving an overdetermined equation as detailed by [X. Li et al.](http://doi.org/10.1038/NMETH.2472). In addition, both cross-correlation and phase-correlation can be used. Sub-pixel image shifts are applied using bilinear interpolation.\r\n\r\n![clAlign GUI](./Images/GUI.png)\r\n\r\n1. OpenCL device selector\r\n2. Alignment method selector. Options are 'Normal' and 'Overdetermined.'\r\n3. Correlation method selectors for cross-correlation (XCF) and phase correlation (PCF).\r\n4. B factor. The B factor is used in masking the FFT in the correlation using\r\n![e^{\\frac{1}{2}BH^{2}}](http://www.sciweavers.org/tex2img.php?eq=e%5E%7B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B2%7DBH%5E%7B2%7D%7D&bc=White&fc=Black&im=jpg&fs=12&ff=arev&edit=0)\r\nwhere H is the spatial frequency (units of per pixel).\r\n5. Shift limit. Provides a limit on the error of the shifts when using the overdetermined alignment method.\r\n6. Progress bar.\r\n7. Start align button.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall portions of the code provided by [X.
